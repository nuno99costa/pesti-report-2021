\section{Design}

This section exposes the design process and it's corresponding artefacts. To achieve this, we utilized the C4 model, a technique for modelling the architecture of software systems \parencite{Brown_2018}.

This system documents a software system architecture by showing multiple levels, decomposing said system into containers and components. We mention all of these levels in this section, except for the code diagrams, which are included in the implementation section, excluding the code diagrams for the Ray Tune component, which are included in this section.
