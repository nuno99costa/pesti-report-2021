\subsection{Final Remarks}

In retrospect, the author is overwhelmingly satisfied with the project, the knowledge obtained while developing and the new experiences provided by the field explored (\acrshort{machinel}) and by the team at \faro.

Orchestrating a project that integrates a variety of systems and services has provided the author with valuable insight into API management. The tight connection with \acrshort{machinel} through the \acrshort{hpo} algorithms also enabled the author to understand if this field of research was of academic interest in the future.

The usage of a programming language that the author is somewhat familiar with provided stable ground to start the internship, and with the help of the Research and Development team at \faro the internship progress was continuous and without hitches.

The introduction of new concepts, in terms of \acrshort{machinel}, was a somewhat difficult experience, but with proper researching the author was able to overcome this and understand the introduced concepts.

Overall, the author has found this internship to be of positive net worth, both academically and professionally and is thankful to all stakeholders and intervening parts in this project.
