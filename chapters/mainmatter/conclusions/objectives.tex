\subsection{Achieved Objectives}

Initially the following objectives were defined:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop 3 algorithm training solutions
	\item Develop meaningful unit tests for these solutions
	\item Integrate the solutions into pre-existing software
	\item Demonstrate value by solving real world issues in CAM2\textsuperscript{\textregistered} software with the developed solutions
\end{itemize}

After finalizing the project, we can say each of these goals was achieved with various degrees of success. We have effectively developed a solution that includes a wide range of \acrshort{hpo} algorithms to use, most of which are academically tested and state of the art.

We have developed tests for the developed infrastructure behind the solution. Unfortunately and due to the random nature and resource intensive operation of the algorithms used, we cannot reliably test the results of the \acrshort{hpo} process.

We have successfully integrated the solution into CAM2 by communicating with it, allowing for command execution, a requirement for the correct functionality of the developed solution.

Finally, we were also able to demonstrate real world value to the team at \faro, showing that there is indeed improvements to be made on the default hyper parameters.
