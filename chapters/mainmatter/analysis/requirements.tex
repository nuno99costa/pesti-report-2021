\subsection{Functional and Non-functional Requirements}

Initially four use cases where defined:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A privileged developer can integrate new \acrshort{hpo} algorithms into the framework.
	\item A developer can select which optimization algorithms will be ran.
	\item A developer can define parameters for the optimization algorithms that will be running.
	\item A developer can obtain information on the optimization process.
\end{itemize}

Here we define a privileged developer as a developer who is connected to the development of the framework.
