\subsection{Existing Technologies}

\acrfull{hpo} is an important step in the machine learning development pipeline. This is usually implemented into other frameworks (as part of a complete pipeline framework). We pay special attention to existing frameworks that are model agnostic, written in \acrfull{python} and are able to treat the objective function as a \textit{black box}.

\subsubsection{Open-source Software}

Due to the academic nature of the development of \acrshort{hpo} frameworks, there are a plethora of frameworks, with different optimization techniques, goals and interfaces.
