Machine learning (GLOSSARY HERE) is an evergrowing field (CITE INCREASE IN MACHINE LEARNING), with uses in both commercial and academic situations. As such, every process in it's development process has been a subject to a large amount of research (from new model development to improvements in training and deployment technologies) (CITE INCREASE IN MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH).

One of the most important and impactful areas of research in the ML (GLOSSARY HERE) is hyper parameter optimization (FIND CITATION FOR IMPACTFULLNESS OF HPO(glossary?). This process targets the training process of machine learning algorithms, defining the training steps structure and execution (FIND CITATION FOR THIS).
