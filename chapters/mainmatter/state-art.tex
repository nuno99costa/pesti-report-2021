\section{State of the Art}

Every \acrshort{machinel} algorithm has hyper parameters \parencite[ch.\ 1]{Feurer2019} which control the learning process. These parameters also exist in other algorithms (e.g.\ population control parameters in evolutionary algorithms \parencite{ptuningevo2011}). These parameters are usually relevant to the final result of training an algorithm \parencite{Bergstra2012}.

Hyper parameters can be set to default values (usually handled by the software packages used) or to community accepted values (usually based on experience and previous literature).

With the advancements of technology and machine learning research,
